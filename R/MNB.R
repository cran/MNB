#' Diagnostic tools as residual analysis, global, local and total-local influence
#'      for the multivariate model from the random intercept Poisson-GlG mode. Including
#'      also, the estimation process by maximum likelihood and generating multivariate
#'      negative binomial data.

#' Seizures data
#'
#' @description The data set described in Diggle et.al (2013) refers to an experiment in which 59 epileptic patients
#' were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: treatment (progabide drug) and placebo groups.
#' The number of seizures experienced by each patient during the baseline period (week eight) and the four consecutive
#' periods (every two weeks) was recorded. The main goal of this application is to analyze the drug effect with
#' respect to the placebo. Two dummies covariates are considered in this study; Group which assumes values equal
#' to 1 if the patient belongs to treatment group and 0 otherwise, and Period which assumes values equal to 1 if the
#' number of seizures are recorded during the treatment and 0 if are measured in the baseline period. It is taking
#' into account the Time covariate which represents the number of weeks required for the counting of seizures in each
#' patient of the placebo and treatment groups.

#' Alzheimer data
#'
#' @description The Alzheimer’s data is presented in Hand and Taylor (1987) and Hand and
#' Crowder (1996) to assess deterioration aspects of intellect, self-care and
#' personality in senile patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Two groups of patients
#' were compared, one of which received a placebo and the other treatment with
#' lecithin. In the data, each of the subjects, 26 in the placebo group and 22
#' in the lecithin group, were measured on five occasions (initially, 1st, 2nd, 4th and 6th).
#' The measurements were the number of words that the patients could recalled from lists of words.
